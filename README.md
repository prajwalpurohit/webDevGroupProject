# PAJFAJ-Group-Project

This project is made as a submission for COMP229's final term project. The web app is a survey generator/survey collection app that allows users to create their own surveys, and answer other surveys anonymously.
The project primarily uses the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js).
The project also uses several dependencies as well, including Bootstrap, Mongoose, and Fontawesome.<br>
This is the first release, and we plan to implement the following in future releases:
- Authentication
- Survey Generation
